This is a little project that I made with the help of some Youtube tutorials on world generation. I used
the knowledge aquired from those videos to make this project for you to download. However there will be no textures and only colors
if you don't install the assets package and put it in the same folder the minecraft.py file is in. 

Controls:
F to toggle building mode
Left click to place a block
Right click to destroy the block (Make sure the red cursor is pointing toward the block you want to break)
WSAD to move
Space bar to jump

You have infinite reach when destroying blocks
